# Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript and ES Modules (import/export) everywhere
- Pages & Layouts: default export only (Next.js requirement)
- Utilities & Hooks: named exports for clarity
- Reusable UI Components: default export is fine
- Use absolute imports with @/* aliases via tsconfig.json
- Components: PascalCase (UserCard.tsx)
- Hooks: start with "use" prefix (useAuth.ts)
- Utilities: camelCase (formatDate.ts)
- Assets: kebab-case (profile-photo.png)
- Formatting: 2 spaces, semicolons on, double quotes, printWidth 80
- Auto-sort imports with eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort (order: third-party ‚Üí @/* ‚Üí relative)
- Auto-sort Tailwind classes with prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
- ESLint extends: next/core-web-vitals, @typescript-eslint recommended, prettier
- Prettier and ESLint configs are in .prettierrc and .eslintrc.json

# Playwright Design Verification Subagent
IMPORTANT: Use the 'design-reviewer' subagent IMMEDIATELY after any frontend changes to verify implementation:

## Subagent Workflow (Required for all frontend changes):
1. **Change Analysis**: Review modified components/pages to identify affected views
2. **Navigation**: Use 'mcp_playwright_browser_navigate' to visit each changed page/view
3. **Design Compliance**: Compare implementation against /context/design-principles.md and /context/style-guide.md
4. **Feature Validation**: Ensure changes fulfill the specific user request
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Verify against any provided requirements or context files
6. **Evidence Capture**: Take full page screenshots at 1440px desktop viewport of each changed view
7. **Error Detection**: Check console messages with 'mcp_playwright_browser_console_messages'
8. **Report Generation**: Provide summary of compliance issues, errors, and recommendations

## Required MCP Tools:
- mcp_playwright_browser_navigate: Navigate to pages/views
- mcp_playwright_browser_console_messages: Check for JavaScript errors
- mcp_playwright_browser_screenshot: Capture evidence at 1440px viewport
- mcp_playwright_browser_viewport: Set viewport to 1440px desktop

## Design Files Reference:
- /context/design-principles.md: Core design principles and guidelines
- /context/style-guide.md: Visual style specifications and component standards
- /context/: Additional design documentation and assets

## Trigger Conditions:
- After editing React components (.tsx, .jsx files)
- After modifying page files (src/pages/, src/app/)
- After updating CSS/styling (Tailwind classes, CSS modules)
- After changing layout or UI-related code
- When user explicitly requests design verification

## Usage Instructions:
After making any frontend changes, ALWAYS use:
```
Use the Task tool with subagent_type: "design-reviewer" to verify the frontend changes I just made
```

The subagent should:
1. Start the dev server (npm run dev) if not running
2. Navigate to affected pages using mcp_playwright_browser_navigate
3. Set viewport to 1440px using mcp_playwright_browser_viewport
4. Take screenshots using mcp_playwright_browser_screenshot
5. Check console for errors using mcp_playwright_browser_console_messages
6. Compare against design files in /context/ directory
7. Report any issues, non-compliance, or recommendations

# Development Environment Setup
- Node.js: Use Node 20 LTS (minimum ‚â•18.18). Use nvm: nvm install 20 && nvm use 20
- Package manager: npm (default)
- Global tools: Git and nvm
- Installation: npm install (Playwright browsers auto-install via postinstall hook)
- Environment variables required:
  - Public: NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME
  - Cloudinary: CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET (or CLOUDINARY_URL)
  - Calendly: CALENDLY_API_TOKEN (PAT), CALENDLY_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY
  - Sanity: NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID, NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET, SANITY_API_VERSION, SANITY_TOKEN (optional)
  - Resend: RESEND_API_KEY
- Optional: Sanity Studio embedded at /studio
- Fonts: Use next/font (no extra keys needed)
- Playwright auto-starts Next.js dev server for E2E tests

# Context Documentation Requirements

## Required Documentation Files (To be created)
These files must be created to support the Playwright design verification subagent:

### Design Documentation
- `/context/design-principles.md` - Core design principles and guidelines for fitness/wellness branding
- `/context/style-guide.md` - Visual style specifications, colors, typography, component standards
- `/context/component-library.md` - Reusable UI component documentation
- `/context/brand-guidelines.md` - Brand voice, tone, and messaging for fitness professionals

### Content Templates
- `/context/content-templates.md` - Sample content for trainers and therapists
- `/context/seo-guidelines.md` - SEO best practices for local fitness businesses
- `/context/accessibility-requirements.md` - WCAG compliance standards

### Technical Context
- `/context/performance-standards.md` - Page speed and Core Web Vitals targets
- `/context/mobile-first-requirements.md` - Mobile responsiveness specifications

## Documentation Status
**Current**: No context files exist yet
**Priority**: Create design-principles.md and style-guide.md first for subagent functionality

# Claude Code Hooks Configuration
Configure these hooks in Claude Code settings for automated design verification:

## Post-Edit Hook (Recommended):
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "post-edit": {
      "trigger": "file_extension_match",
      "patterns": ["*.tsx", "*.jsx", "*.css", "*.module.css"],
      "command": "echo 'Frontend file modified. Run design verification subagent.'",
      "auto_trigger": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Manual Trigger Command:
Add this alias to quickly trigger design verification:
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias verify-design="echo 'Use Task tool with subagent_type: design-reviewer to verify frontend changes'"
```

# Repository Etiquette
- Workflow: GitHub Flow (branch from main ‚Üí PR ‚Üí review ‚Üí squash-merge ‚Üí delete branch)
- Branch naming: {type}/{optional-ticket}-{short-kebab-description}
  - Types: feature/, fix/, chore/, docs/, refactor/, test/, ci/, hotfix/
  - Examples: feature/123-add-auth-flow, fix/navbar-overlap-mobile
- Commit messages: Use Conventional Commits (type(scope): description)
  - Examples: feat(auth): add passwordless login, fix(nav): correct focus trap
- Merge strategy: Squash & merge PRs into main (linear history)
- PRs required for main (no direct pushes ever)
- Minimum 1 approval required before merge
- Required status checks: lint, type-check, tests must pass
- Prefer small, focused PRs with clear descriptions
- Branch protection enabled on main with linear history requirement

# Important Warnings & Behaviors
- Static files: Only public/ is web-served. Files in assets/ are not public unless imported in code
- next/image + Cloudinary: Must whitelist external URLs in images.remotePatterns in next.config.js
- Netlify uses Netlify Image CDN for next/image (optimizes & caches at edge)
- App Router caching: Next.js caches aggressively. Control with fetch options or revalidation (revalidatePath, revalidateTag)
- Environment variables: Only prefix with NEXT_PUBLIC_ if browser must see them. Keep secrets server-only
- Netlify limits: Functions ~30s sync/15m background/1GB memory/6MB payloads; Edge Functions 20MB bundle/512MB memory/~50ms CPU
- Sanity Studio: Use catch-all route at /studio. Pin SANITY_API_VERSION to fixed date
- Calendly webhooks: Reschedules trigger both invitee.canceled and invitee.created (handle idempotency)
- Cloudinary security: Never expose API_SECRET client-side. Use signed uploads or restricted unsigned presets

# Additional Context
- Design system: Use Geist font everywhere (loaded via next/font)
- UI kit: shadcn/ui components on Radix UI primitives
- Design docs: DesignSystem.md and DesignPrinciples.md at repo root
- Design reviews: Use sub-agents for design QA (naming, spacing, states, a11y)
- Key integrations: Cloudinary (whitelist in images.remotePatterns), Sanity (embedded at /studio), Calendly (PAT + webhooks), Resend (server-only API key)
- Performance: Prefer Server Components, lazy-load with next/dynamic, track bundle size with @next/bundle-analyzer, use next/font and next/image
- SEO: Use Metadata API for titles/descriptions, add robots.txt and sitemap.ts, create local landing pages (service + city/area with unique content), maintain Google Business Profile with accurate NAP, add LocalBusiness JSON-LD structured data
- Deployment: Netlify uses OpenNext adapter, next/image uses Netlify Image CDN
- Workflow: GitHub Flow with Conventional Commits, squash-merge, 1 approval + required checks
- Use PageSpeed Insights reports with Claude to identify and fix performance issues
